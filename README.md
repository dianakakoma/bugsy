# Bugsy

#The Bugsy application allows an end-user to quickly and easily submit a bug report with a screenshot.#

**User Story**
<br>
As a user, I want to be able to submit bug reports or feature requests easily and quickly.

**Road Map**
<br>
This MVC/CRUD application is going to make it easier for end-users to make actionable bug reports by easily incorporating the URL with the issue as well as allowing the user to include a screenshot of the issue.
In addition to bug reports, this application will allow users to make feature requests while using the software. Again the URL will be captured and the user can upload a photo that supports their request.
I started the Rails backend with the PostgreSQL database. I also created the models and controllers and seeded the database. This week's plan is to complete the backend by building out the MVC structure, test routes, controllers and views with Insomnia. 

This stripped-down build is to work out the kinks in the Heroku deployment. 
v2.0 with user authentication, rSpec testing, validations and a Vue.js frontend will be deployed to Netlify.


The little big things:

* Ruby version - 2.6.5

* Rails version - Rails 6.0.3.2

* Testing - Insomnia - 

* Database - PostreSQL

* Deployment - in progress
